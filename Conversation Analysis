#Why it matters?
Understanding TCP/UDP conversations help me see and understand:
- Who is talking to who (IP source/IP destination)
- How long session persist
- Which ports/services are active

#Useful features:
- Statistics => conversations
- Statistics => endpoint

This helps me to identify internal vs external activity, and repeated connection (eg beconing)
